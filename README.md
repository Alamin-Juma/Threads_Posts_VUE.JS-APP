## How to navigate this project
- Somewhat complex stateful logic: [https://github.com/Alamin-Juma/github-search-tool]
- Responsive CSS using styled-components:
- The application fetches data from the Github API: Examples for the request [bhttps://api.github.com/users/${query}

## HowI built the project
- used asynchronous programming with Vanilla JS to build a Github search page
- async/await to return promise from A Github API 
- Querying https://api.github.com/users/${query} by passing the searched param as a query to get the json data
- rendering the json data to the front end page like 

## If I had more time I would change this
- used React for component based architecure rather than manipulating the dom directly 
- Set up continuous integration to run the tests and ESLint on every Pull Request
- Add end-to-end tests with Cypress.
